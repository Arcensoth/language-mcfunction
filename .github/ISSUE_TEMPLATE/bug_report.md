**Bug report checklist:**
[ ] The language-mcfunction extension only provides syntax highlighting. Have you confirmed that your issue is with the syntax highlighting, and **not** other features such as squiggly underlines, warning indicators, and/or pop-ups?
[ ] Ensure that you are able to reproduce the issue without any other datapack-related extensions enabled.
[ ] Make sure you attach a screenshot to your bug report. Bug reports without a screenshot will be closed.
