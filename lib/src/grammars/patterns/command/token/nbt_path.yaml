# This one is tricky, because we won't know when to start recursing.
# There's also a lot of overlap with other token types, like strings.
# So what we're going to do is require at least one character familiar to
# NBT paths, like dots or opening braces, immediately following a word.
# We use lookahead here so that we can process the syntax more accurately
# after we're more confident that the token is an NBT path.
begin: '{{command_token_l}}(?=\w+[\.\[\{])'

# It's impossible to know what an NBT path will end on, so apart from being
# careful about newlines like usual we just accept anything.
# end: '{{lookahead_newline}}|({{not_command_token_delim}}*)'
end: "{{command_token_r}}"
