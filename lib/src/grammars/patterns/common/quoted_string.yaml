patterns:
  # consume everything except for backslashes, quotes, and newlines
  - match: '[^\\\"\n]'
    name: "#quoted_string"
  # consume any escaped characters... except for newlines
  - match: '\\[^\n]'
    name: "#quoted_string_escape"
  # consume a single backslash (implicitly followed by a newline) as an error
  - match: '\\'
    name: "#error"
  # anything else will be handed back to the parent scope
